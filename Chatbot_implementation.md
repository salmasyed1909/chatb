### DESCRIPTION

!!! info "What is the requirement of the project?"
    - The project aims to implement a chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries using NLP.
    - It involves data preprocessing, intent recognition, training NLP models, and deploying the chatbot.

??? info "Why is it necessary?"
    - Chatbots provide automated customer support, enhancing user experience.
    - They reduce human workload and ensure 24/7 availability for user interactions.
    - Useful in e-commerce, healthcare, banking, and educational sectors.

??? info "How is it beneficial and used?"
    - Customer Support: Provides instant responses to FAQs.
    - Virtual Assistance: Helps users with daily tasks.
    - Business Automation: Automates repetitive tasks.
    - Education: Provides tutoring and learning support.
    - Healthcare: Assists with symptom checking and appointment scheduling.

??? info "How did you start approaching this project? (Initial thoughts and planning)"
    - Data Collection: Gather user queries and responses.
    - Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
    - Model Training: Use ML/NLP models like TF-IDF, LSTMs, or Transformers.
    - Response Generation: Rule-based, retrieval-based, or generative methods.
    - Deployment: Deploy using Flask/Django and integrate with APIs.

### EXPLANATION

#### DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES

---

#### WHAT I HAVE DONE

=== "Step 1"

    Data Collection and Exploration:

      - Collected datasets containing user queries and chatbot responses.
      - Analyzed the dataset structure and intent distribution.

=== "Step 2"

    Data Preprocessing:

      - Tokenized sentences and removed stopwords.
      - Performed lemmatization using Spacy.
      - Cleaned and normalized text data.

=== "Step 3"

    Intent Classification:

      - Implemented TF-IDF and word embeddings.
      - Used machine learning models like Naive Bayes and SVM.

=== "Step 4"

    Chatbot Model Training:

      - Trained deep learning models such as LSTMs and Transformers.
      - Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.

=== "Step 5"

    Model Optimization:

      - Applied dropout and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
      - Used grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

=== "Step 6"

    Deployment and Testing:

      - Built a Flask API to integrate the chatbot.
      - Tested responses using real-time user queries.

#### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS

=== "Trade-off 1"

    Handling ambiguous user queries.

      - **Solution**: Used fallback responses and confidence thresholds.

=== "Trade-off 2"

    Computational cost for deep learning models.

      - **Solution**: Optimized model using smaller embeddings and transfer learning.

??? tip "Sample Chatbot Interactions"

    === "User Query: 'What is AI?'"
        **Bot Response:** "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines."
    
    === "User Query: 'Tell me a joke'"
        **Bot Response:** "Why did the computer get cold? Because it left its Windows open!"
